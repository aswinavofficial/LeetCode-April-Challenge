1. Single Number <br/>
   Solved using XOR operation
   If we XOR a number 0, we get same number and if we XOR number with itself we get 0. So, if we perform XOR operation on each number, at last only the number which  doesn't twice occur will be the result.

2 . Happy Number

    Stored the result to a list & check if the result already present in list or not. If it is there then it will lead to an infinite loop and it is not a happy number. Else if result is 1 then return true.
